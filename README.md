# Algoritms 2

### Made by
 - Chris Rosendorf
 - Viktor Kim Christiansen
 - William Pfaffe

# Description
The following algoritms have been implemented:
- LinkedList
- Hashmap
- Binary Search Tree (Red-Black Balanced)

Each of these have been timed, showing which is faster than the other. We didn't get to implement the FlexibleArray, as we couldn't decipher what the slide meant, and what the array was about.

# Installation
You might have issues running this, as Java acts different from IDE to IDE. This was made with IntelliJ, so you may need the community edition for it to be run properly.
